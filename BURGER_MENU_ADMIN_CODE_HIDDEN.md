# Burger Menu Admin Code Hidden - COMPLETE

## Changes Made

### 1. Admin Code Input Hidden
- Admin code is now invisible when typing
- Only placeholder "Admin kodi" shows
- Text color set to transparent
- Cursor color remains visible (#00d4ff)
- User can type but cannot see what they're typing

### 2. No Visible Text in Burger Menu
- Admin code input: completely hidden
- Only placeholder visible
- Buttons remain visible: "Kirish", "Bekor"
- Professional and secure appearance

## How It Works

**Admin Code Input:**
- `color: transparent` - hides typed text
- `caretColor: '#00d4ff'` - shows cursor
- `placeholder: 'Admin kodi'` - shows hint
- User types code but sees nothing
- Code is still stored in state
- User presses Enter or clicks "Kirish"
